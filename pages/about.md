Hello! My name is Artyom Tetyukhin, and I am a Software Development Engineer based in Russia. This blog explores a variety of topics that I’ve stumbled across in my journey as a software engineer. Even though mostly written for my own understanding, my hope is that the curious programmer finds my writings entertaining.
